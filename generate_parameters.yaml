  # This can be any module that is importable with Python.
  # It can be something local to the directory where you run ESPEI, or provided
  # by an package you have installed. To know if it will work, start a Python
  # interpreter in the same place where you will run the ESPEI executable and
  # try to do the import:
  # >>> from custom_elastic_model import elastic_fitting_description
  # if that works, then ESPEI should also be able to use it.
